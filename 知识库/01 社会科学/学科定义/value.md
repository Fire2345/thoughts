In [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics") and [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science "Social science"), **value** denotes the degree of importance of some thing or action, with the aim of determining 

- which actions are best to do 
- what way is best to live 
- to describe the significance of different actions. 

Value systems are proscriptive and prescriptive [beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beliefs "Beliefs")（价值体系是具有禁令性和指令性的信念[[belief]]）; they affect the ethical behavior of a person or are the basis of their intentional activities. 

Often primary values are strong and secondary values are suitable for changes. 

What makes an action valuable may in turn depend on the ethical values of the objects it increases, decreases, or alters.
