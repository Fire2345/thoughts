**Confirmation bias** is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior [beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief "Belief") or [values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_\(ethics_and_social_sciences\) "Value (ethics and social sciences)"). 

People display this bias when they select information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information or when they interpret **ambiguous** evidence as supporting their existing attitudes.

The confirmation bias happens due to the natural way the brain works, so **eliminating it is impossible**.
